# dada

Project to initialize different development environments using Go. I have
dotfiles for most of my development configuration, this project is an attempt
to create a richer application to bootstrap these dotfiles into development
environments.

## State

This project is in a very early development phase so I wouldn't recommend
using it at this stage.
